4. Start a lobby using a unique name or stream to an already existing one (take it over from a friend finishing their stint?).
5. Launch the [UI service](http://iremoteengineer.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/) in your device of choice - same or different PC, mobile phone or a tablet. Once on the page, find your lobby and become a remote engineer.
